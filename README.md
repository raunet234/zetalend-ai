   # From the root directory
   yarn frontend:dev
   ```

2. Compile smart contracts:
   ```bash
   yarn contract:compile
   ```

3. Run contract tests:
   ```bash
   yarn contract:test
   ```

## Deployment

1. Deploy smart contracts to ZetaChain Athens testnet:
   ```bash
   yarn contract:deploy
   ```

2. Verify contracts on ZetaChain Explorer:
   ```bash
   yarn contract:verify
   ```

3. Update contract address:
   - Copy the deployed contract address
   - Update `ZETALEND_ADDRESS` in `frontend/src/utils/contracts.ts`

4. Deploy frontend to Vercel:
   ```bash
   # From the frontend directory
   vercel
   ```

## Testing

1. Get testnet tokens:
   - Goerli ETH: [Goerli Faucet](https://goerlifaucet.com)
   - BSC Testnet BNB: [BSC Faucet](https://testnet.binance.org/faucet-smart)
   - ZetaChain Athens: [ZetaChain Faucet](https://labs.zetachain.com/get-zeta)

2. Test cross-chain functionality:
   - Connect wallet
   - Switch to Goerli testnet
   - Deposit ETH
   - Switch to BSC testnet
   - Borrow USDT
   - Monitor transaction status

Installation
bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/raunet234/zetalend-ai.git
cd zetalend-ai

# Install dependencies
npm install
cd frontend && npm install && cd ../

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Deploy smart contracts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network zetachain_testnet

# Start the frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
Environment Setup
Create .env file with:

env
# ZetaChain Configuration
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
ZETACHAIN_RPC_URL=https://zetachain-athens-evm.blockpi.network/v1/rpc/public

# Frontend Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=deployed_contract_address
📖 How It Works
1. Connect Wallet
Users connect MetaMask and the app automatically detects supported networks.

2. Choose Assets & Chains
Source Chain: Where you deposit collateral (e.g., Ethereum)
Target Chain: Where you want to borrow (e.g., BSC)
Assets: ETH, USDT, USDC, and more
3. ZetaChain Magic
Our Universal Smart Contract on ZetaChain:

Receives your collateral deposit
Calculates loan eligibility
Executes cross-chain asset transfer
Manages loan state across all chains
4. Instant Cross-Chain Lending
Receive your borrowed assets on the target chain in under 2 minutes!
